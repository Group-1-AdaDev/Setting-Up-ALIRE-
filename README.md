# Setting-Up-ALIRE-on-Ubuntu-
*ALIRE Set-up Session Report.*

Below is a step-by-step download of ALIRE on Ubuntu software that I did in my programming class, guided by my lecturer. 

I first searched (AdaCore Gnat Academic Program -https://github.com/GNAT-Academic-Program) on the browser. 


Download and unzip the file (https://github.com/alire-project/alire/releases/download/v2.0.2/alr-2.0.2-bin-x86_64-linux.zip).
Copy the file from the download's section to home.

Open the terminal.
Type 'nano ~/.bashrc' and press 'Enter'. Copy the file from home. 
Type export PATH="${PATH}:(paste the copied file here) then type :$PATH" 
Press Ctrl+letter O and press Enter to save the file.
Press Ctrl +letter x to exit the file.

In the terminal, type nano ~/.bashrc then press Enter. 
Type source ~/.bashrc then press Enter. 
Type 'which alr' press enter.
Type alr then press enter.
